This operation is used to delete strings from the Trie data structure. There are three cases when deleting a word from Trie:
1. The deleted word is a prefix of other words in Trie.
2. The deleted word shares a common prefix with other words in Trie.
3. The deleted word does not share any common prefix with other words in Trie.


```python
def delete_word(root, word):
	current_node = root
	last_branch_node = None
	last_branch_char = 'a'

	for char in word:
		char_ascii_value = ord(char)
		index = char_ascii_value - a_ASCII_VALUE
		
		if current_node.children[index] is None:
			return False

		count = 0

		for i in range(26):
			if current_node.children[i] is not None:
				count += 1

		if count > 1:
			last_branch_node = current_node
			last_branch_char = char

		current_node = current_node.children[index]

	count = 0

	for i in range(26):
		if current_node.children[i] is not None:
			count += 1

	# Case 1
	if count > 0:
		current_node.word_count -= 1
		return True

	# Case 2
	if last_branch_node is not None:
		last_branch_char_index = ord(last_branch_char) - a_ASCII_VALUE
		last_branch_node.children[last_branch_char_index] = None
		return True

	# Case 3
	else:
		root_first_char_index = ord(word[0]) - a_ASCII_VALUE
		root.children[root_first_char_index] = None
		return True
```
