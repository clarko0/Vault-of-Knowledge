### Describes methods of communicating with all stakeholders that is determined by the audience and/or their level of technical knowledge. (Compares and contrasts the different types of communication used for technical and non-technical audiences and the benefits of these types of communication methods.)

*Describe how you tailor communication methods to different stakeholders based on their technical knowledge. For example, when communicating with technical team members, you might use detailed technical jargon, diagrams, and code snippets, while for non-technical stakeholders, you simplify explanations, use analogies, and focus on high-level concepts and outcomes. Compare the benefits of each approachâ€”technical communication ensures precise, in-depth understanding, while non-technical communication ensures clarity and keeps all stakeholders aligned. Highlight specific instances where you've adapted your communication style to effectively convey information to different audiences.*

When communicating with a technical audience, you'll often use: detailed terminology, diagrams, and code snippets, while for a non-technical stakeholders, you will: simplify explanations, use analogies, and focus on high-level concepts and outcomes. Here are some examples of communication methods I use within the work place:

When a person creates a feedback ticket for a new feature/bug fix, I'll usually talk to them face-to-face, with the majority of users creating tickets being non-technical, it helps me get a greater understanding of what they are wanting to update. Once I know what I need to know, I'll add a comment to the feedback ticket, translating their idea into technical terminology for software developers to understand.

A great method of communication with our UI designer is over Figma. Figma is an interface design tool, which allows software developers and UI designers collaborate while designing a product. For example: a UI designer would be able to create a button, and in real-time the software developer can critique the button's styling. When the developer is happy with it, they're able to easily copy the styling as html and CSS to use in the codebase.

Figma is great for technical audiences, if you're attempting to communicate a user interface to a non-technical audience, it's often best to just develop it in html and CSS, then send them a teams message containing the screenshots.

The best form of communication between software developers and code reviewers is with Azure DevOps. The software dev is able to create a git Pull Request, and the reviewer is able to easily see the changes that have been made. If there is ever any issues, the reviewer can add a comment on the specific line of code - allowing for the developer to understand visually what's wrong.
