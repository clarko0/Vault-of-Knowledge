A user story is a short, informal description of a software feature or product functionality from the perspective of the end user. They are usually in the format:

```
As a [role]
I want to [software goal]
so that [result]
```

I was recently assigned the task of creating a "Compliance Tracker", which allows us track the failure of parts manufactured within our workshop. These mistakes are logged and needed to be assign(ed) to people and closed by a "Compliance Tracker Admin" role. This page is also to show statistics to any user.

With this in mind, during the analysis stage of this project's development cycle, I came up with these initial user stories:

```
As a Compliance Tracker Manager
I want to be able to assign an issue to a user
so that they can work on resolving it.
```

```
As a user
I want to be able to apply filters to the graphs
so that it is easier for me to understand the data
```

```
As a Compliance Tracker Manager
I want to be able to close an issue
so that it notifies users that it's completed/doesn't need any more work on it.
```

With this all in mind I was able to make the following Use Cases for the project:
