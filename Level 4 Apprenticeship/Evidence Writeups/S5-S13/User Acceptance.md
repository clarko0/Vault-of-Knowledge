### User Acceptance Testing Holiday Creation

**20th September 2024**

User Acceptance Testing (UAT), also known as application testing or end-user testing, is a stage in the software development process where the software is evaluated under real-world conditions by its intended users. Often serving as the final phase before release, UAT is conducted to ensure that the software can effectively handle practical tasks and meets the specified development criteria. The primary goal of UAT is to verify that the software performs according to expectations and is ready for its target market.

At Labman, as a final step, before releasing the new holiday entry form, I user acceptance tested it. The way this works, is I put the code onto a quality assurance (QA) server, and send links to several users who are most likely to use the new module. They will then have a play with it and check if it is what they expected the final product should be.

If they are happy with the product, I will schedule a deployment of the new module, however if they don't like it, I would review their revisions and break them into user stories, helping me decide if the changes are worth developing or not.
