### My Commitment To Continued Professional Development

Building upon the importance of continued professional development, I have actively pursued opportunities to expand my skill set beyond my primary responsibilities at Labman. While my main role involves working on the intranet, I recognized that another project within the company utilizes microservice architecture—a modern approach that breaks applications into smaller, independent services. Understanding that proficiency in this area would be valuable, I took the initiative to learn how microservices work and how to deploy and develop them using Docker, a leading containerization platform.

To facilitate my learning, I leveraged educational resources like the comprehensive YouTube tutorial "[Microservices with .NET 5 & Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFDbh1c9zyE)." This resource provided me with foundational knowledge and practical insights into building and managing microservices. However, I wanted to solidify my understanding through hands-on experience. Therefore, I embarked on creating my own project—an API that incorporated several key features of microservice architecture.

In this project, I developed an identity service to handle user authentication, allowing people to log in and sign up securely. I created a video service that enabled CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on video records. To manage communication between these services, I implemented an API gateway service, which facilitated data transfer and ensured secure interactions using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with specific claims. This practical application not only reinforced my theoretical knowledge but also enhanced my skills in deploying microservices with Docker.

This initiative demonstrates my commitment to continued professional development in several ways. First, it shows proactive learning—I identified a relevant technology and sought out resources to master it independently. Second, by applying this knowledge in a real-world project, I translated learning into practical skills that are directly applicable to current and future projects at Labman. Lastly, it highlights my dedication to staying current with industry trends, which is crucial in the ever-evolving field of software engineering. This continuous learning mindset enables me to contribute more effectively to my team and adapt to new challenges, ultimately driving innovation and success within the organization.
