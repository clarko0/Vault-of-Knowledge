### Unexpected Change Management at Labman

Managing unexpected changes properly is crucial to prevent them from becoming time-consuming issues.

While working at Labman, I was assigned an important feedback ticket to update our compliance tracker. The task was fully specified for me, so I dove right in. After completing the work according to the technical specifications, I deployed it to the QA server and sent it over to the ticket author for review.

A day later, I received a huge list of changes from them. With only a week assigned to this ticket—and already having used three out of the five days—I realized I needed to handle this carefully to stay within budget. I went through all the requested changes, breaking them down into user stories, and estimated that implementing all of them would take an additional three days.

My first instinct was to ask my project manager if I could get an extra day to work on this. However, he told me no, pointing out that I had already completed everything in the original specification. He said that these extra requests weren't strictly necessary and suggested that I prioritize the changes to fit within the remaining time. Any low-priority items could be put into a separate ticket to tackle later when time allowed.

So, I went back to the list of changes and started prioritizing them. I communicated with the ticket author to understand which changes were most critical. By focusing on the high-priority items, I was able to make significant improvements without exceeding the budget. The less critical changes were documented for future consideration.

This experience taught me the importance of managing scope creep and effectively communicating with both project managers and stakeholders to ensure that unexpected changes don't derail the project timeline.
