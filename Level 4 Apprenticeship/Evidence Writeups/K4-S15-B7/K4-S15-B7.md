### Communication Methods Between Stakeholders At Labman

When communicating with a technical audience, you'll often use: detailed terminology, diagrams, and code snippets, while for a non-technical stakeholders, you will: simplify explanations, use analogies, and focus on high-level concepts and outcomes. Here are some examples of communication methods I use within the work place:

When a person creates a feedback ticket for a new feature/bug fix, I'll usually talk to them face-to-face, with the majority of users creating tickets being non-technical, it helps me get a greater understanding of what they are wanting to update. Once I know what I need to know, I'll add a comment to the feedback ticket, translating their idea into technical terminology for software developers to understand.

A great method of communication with our UI designer is over Figma. Figma is an interface design tool, which allows software developers and UI designers collaborate while designing a product. For example: a UI designer would be able to create a button, and in real-time the software developer can critique the button's styling. When the developer is happy with it, they're able to easily copy the styling as html and CSS to use in the codebase.

The communication methods of face-to-face discussions for feedback tickets and collaborative design using Figma differ in their audience, purpose, and execution but share the goal of effective collaboration. 

Face-to-face discussions cater to non-technical users, simplifying complex ideas into understandable terms and focusing on high-level outcomes, while Figma is tailored for technical stakeholders, enabling real-time collaboration with detailed design and coding terminology. 

The former relies on verbal communication and active listening to translate user needs into actionable technical tasks, fostering personal connections and trust. In contrast, Figma uses visual prototypes and technical precision to align UI designers and developers on design implementation, optimizing efficiency and reducing errors. 

Both methods highlight the importance of adapting communication to the audience, with face-to-face bridging the gap between technical and non-technical, and Figma enhancing collaboration within technical teams.

### Witness Statement

To show my knowledge on this I was able to get a witness statement from my manager Rich:

Arthur adapts his communication style to suit both technical and non-technical stakeholders. For instance, when a non-technical employee reported an issue with our work management system, Arthur had a brief, face-to-face meeting to get a good understanding before translating the bug fix into a technical specification. This ensured that the developer would understand the requirements clearly and the fix was implemented efficiently.
