### Collaborative Working At Labman

In my role at Labman, I have actively collaborated with colleagues across various roles to enhance our internal business tools on the intranet. Recently, I worked closely with our UI designer, who utilizes Figma for design work, to redesign the MTL compliance tracker. This collaboration involved integrating his design concepts with the technical aspects of development, ensuring that the final product was both aesthetically pleasing and functionally efficient.

Additionally, I partnered with a tester from our quality assurance team to improve new features. For example, when I developed the functionality for users to upload multiple VAT receipts to a purchase order, the tester conducted thorough QA testing. His feedback was crucial in refining the feature and ensuring it met all user requirements before deployment.

Our software team is rich with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds. I actively listen to my colleagues' perspectives, which has been instrumental in identifying the best solutions for complex problems. By embracing these different ideas, we foster a collaborative environment that values inclusion and diversity.

My positive attitude toward inclusion and diversity is evident in my commitment to creating a supportive atmosphere where every team member feels heard and respected. I believe that by valuing each person's unique contributions, we enhance our ability to innovate and deliver effective solutions for the business.
