 ### Explains the relevance of organisational policies and procedures relating to the tasks being undertaken, and when to follow them including how they have followed company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version, and source control.

*Identify key policies relevant to your work, such as coding standards, security protocols, and documentation requirements. Explain how these policies guide your day-to-day tasks, like adhering to coding guidelines during development or following security protocols when handling sensitive data. Additionally, describe how you follow approaches to version control (e.g., branching strategies in Git), and source control (e.g., committing changes regularly and reviewing pull requests), ensuring consistency and quality in the development process.*

At work, our code is source controlled using git, with our remote branches being located on Azure DevOps. We have a few organisational procedures to make sure pushed into the main branch is of high quality. 

For starters, our version control management practice is trunk-based development, this is where developers merge small, frequent updates to a core "trunk" or main branch. Labman's version of this is pull from main, create a branch using a naming convention, work on what you're doing, and create a pull request. My workflow for creating a branch is:

1. When assigned to a feedback item, that I'm going to work on at present, I'll start off by running `git checkout main`, this will switch my current git working branch to main.

2. I would then pull all changes from the remote branch, to make sure local branch is up-to-date. I'd do this with the command `git fetch origin`

3.  Our naming convention for branches is: 
`<username>_<intranet module>_<feedback item id>_<small imperative sentence of changes being made>`. 
   With this feedback item for example:
   ![[Pasted image 20240829103738.png]]
   My branch name would be `aclarkson_infrastructure_5905_convert-dialog-boxes-to-easy-popups`. I would create this branch with the `git branch aclarkson_infrastructure_5905_convert-dialog-boxes-to-easy-popups`.
   
4. Then to change my local branch to the one I've just created I'd use the command:
   `git checkout aclarkson_infrastructure_5905_convert-dialog-boxes-to-easy-popups`
   ![[Pasted image 20240829104207.png]]
   
To create a remote version of my branch, once I've made a few changes, I'd use the commands:
`git commit -a -m 'init commit + <short description of changes made>'` to create the initial commit to the remote branch.

I'd then run the command:
`git push --set-upstream origin aclarkson_infrastructure_5905_convert-dialog-boxes-to-easy-popups` to create the remote branch.

Every time I make a milestone within my code, it is a work policy to make a commit within the branch with a suitable message. For example `git commit -a -m 'converted all dialog boxes in feedback module to popups'`

Once the code is tested and I'm happy with the code, it's policy that all branches must be pushed into main via a pull request, which has to be approved and code reviewed by a senior developer. To do this, I'd go onto Azure DevOps pull requests page, it usually has the most recently changed branch at the top:

I'd then give the pull request a valid title, description and choose a required reviewer (senior dev):
