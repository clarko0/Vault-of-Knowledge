### Security and Maintainability Compliance At Labman

#### Arthur Clarkson
**3rd October 2024**

On the intranet we follow the N-Layer architecture, with our main layers being: View => Controller => Business => Data, to maximise maintainability we enforce the rule of layers only being able to send data from each other if they're next to each other, that means the View layer isn't able to get data from the Data layer, without going through the Controller and Business layer. 

This helps improve security because each layer is isolated from one another, meaning if one layer is compromised, it will only be that layer affected, rather than the hacker gaining access to the whole system.

Layers communicate through well-defined interfaces, meaning that there is a reduced risk of unintended data exposure or unauthorized access between layers. One way we ensure this, is by handling the permission checks within the Controller layer, this is because: from this layer we are able to dynamically render the View layer's template via a model created in the controller, and we are able to stop users from accessing the business layer.

For example if a user is missing a certain permission, e.g. a permission to be able to delete a record, http GET endpoint will return the view without the delete button within the HTML, and if they attempt to send a request to the http DELETE endpoint, it will do a permissions check and return a 403 Forbidden response.
