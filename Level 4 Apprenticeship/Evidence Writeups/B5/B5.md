Acting with integrity in ethical, legal, and regulatory matters - especially concerning the protection of personal data, safety, and security - is crucial because it builds trust and credibility among stakeholders, ensures compliance to avoid legal penalties, and safeguards personal information against breaches and malicious activities. It enhances organizational culture by promoting ethical values, supports sustainable business practices, and aids in effective risk management. Additionally, it fosters customer loyalty and satisfaction, meets regulatory expectations, upholds industry standards, and reflects a commitment to social responsibility, all of which contribute to long-term success and positive relationships with stakeholders.

On the intranet, we require personal information such as their phone number and address, to protect this data, we encrypted it on the user record, and is only decryptable by a secret that our business layer has access to. This ensures, encase of a breach, that this sensitive data isn't revealed.

By utilizing Microsoft's authentication services for our intranet project, we align with ethical, legal, and regulatory standards by ensuring robust protection of personal data, safety, and security. Microsoft's authentication solutions, such as Azure Active Directory, provide advanced security features like multi-factor authentication, encryption, and continuous security updates, which safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches. This demonstrates our commitment to acting with integrity by adopting trusted, industry-leading security practices that comply with regulations like GDPR. Leveraging Microsoft's established and compliant infrastructure not only protects sensitive information but also fosters trust among stakeholders by upholding our responsibility to secure personal data effectively.
