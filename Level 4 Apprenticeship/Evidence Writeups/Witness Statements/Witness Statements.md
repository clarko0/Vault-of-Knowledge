Arthur is methodical at investigating issues and obstacles. When making changes to our salesforce API, he is able to identify tools (like postman and web proxy solutions) that help him quickly find and reproduce problems and then find solutions. He can configure items, and then systematically got through the relevant steps to pin-point where issues arise.

There are many opportunities at Labman, and Arthur has taken many and been able to improve his knowledge and skills in many areas to exceed the requirements of his role. He has developed windows and Linux environments in both standard installations and within the context of a server, load balanced systems and containers. He has taken on the role of Printer Manager for the business, keeping our fleet of printers both office, and specialised printing services functional for all members of staff.  He is able to fault find, fix and replace parts where needed from small A4 printers, to large format, vinyl and label printing. 

Arthur has been able to continue learning throughout his time picking up skills in C#, JS in the first instance, but has expanded to support VueJS and other frameworks. He is able to interact with internal systems, and 3rd part APIs to complete work learning many APIs including Salesforce, our ticketing system, Azure Devops, Strapi, Wordpress and Teams integration.   

This week he has been working on generic C# expressions to help standardise our database layer for things like DB grouping via Linq.

Arthur is always curious about different areas of the business, with how and why things are done. This extends both technically and practically, and has had the opportunity on many occasions to work with different people around the business. He has spent time with our maintenance team reviewing the setup and features available across the business meeting rooms, to implement a better experience for all staff members. During this time he was able to unify the facilities, find hardware devices compatible with all staff laptops, and maximise the usability for our constant flow of visitors and external people using the meeting rooms.

When working on the Compliance tracker, part way through the project, the customer changed their mind on the original requirements and workflow. Arthur was able to manage this comfortably, and work with the new requirements. He is also aware enough to report this to his manager.

As part of the team, I am able to assign both planned and unplanned work items to Arthur and he is able to complete this without the need to be overseen. He is able to gather requirements, request support and decision where necessary to reach a solution within the deadlines and constraints of the request.
