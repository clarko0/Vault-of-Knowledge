### My Curiosity In Business Context At Labman

Between July and November 2024, I had the opportunity to step beyond my primary role as a Software Developer at Labman. During this period, I engaged in projects that demanded not only my software expertise but also hands-on technical skills in cable management and product design. These experiences significantly broadened my perspective on Labman’s operational and business context.

First, I took responsibility for ensuring all eight of our meeting rooms were equipped with the necessary cables. This involved physically channelling the concrete floor with a wall chaser to run two 5m HDMI cables and one active USB-C cable, ensuring they were neatly arranged and protected.

The USB-C cable was dedicated to a webcam on the TV, while the HDMI cables connected the TV to both an Anker Dock and a custom table power supply. This setup gave team members a reliable 4K display option and easy access to power, Ethernet, and other peripherals.

After extensive research on cable types for a anker dock to a laptop, I ultimately chose a Magtame cable for its ability to easily be coiled (due to their casing being slightly magnetic), enabling a more user-friendly and clutter-free environment.

In parallel, I started designing and manufacturing a whiteboard penholder capable of holding four pens, an eraser, and a spray bottle.

My work on this project underscored the importance of understanding materials and magnet strengths, as I integrated five high-strength countersunk magnets secured with bolts and threaded inserts.

I printed the design on an SLS printer and affixed a neoprene backing to prevent slippage. This iterative process improved my prototype skills and demonstrated the potential of in-house product development.

My curiosity in these broader tasks not only expanded my personal skill set but also drove tangible benefits for Labman. The standardized cable management in meeting rooms greatly reduced technical issues and improved meeting efficiency, saving time for everyone involved. The penholder project highlighted our capacity to rapidly prototype useful office solutions, showcasing a culture of innovation and continuous improvement to colleagues and clients alike.

Conclusion
These cross-functional experiences exemplify how stepping out of a comfort zone can lead to innovative solutions. By embracing a blend of software expertise, practical engineering skills, and user-focused design, I contributed to a smoother work environment and streamlined processes at Labman. Moreover, this approach to problem-solving underscores the value of curiosity—paving the way for higher efficiency, enhanced collaboration, and a lasting positive impact on the company’s operational ecosystem.
