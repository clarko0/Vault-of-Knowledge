### Working Independently at Labman

Working independently is crucial for personal development, improving productivity, and ensuring high-quality work. When I'm assigned a task with a deadline, I typically start by creating user stories and estimating the time needed for each. This helps me structure my work effectively. For example, in a recent project, I developed the following user stories with estimated completion times:

```
As an hourly-holidays user,
I want to see my remaining holiday in hours,
so I can easily track how much holiday I have left.

Estimated duration: 30 minutes
```

```
As a daily-holidays user,
I want to only take a minimum of half a day (4.5 hours),
so I can comply with the company policy.

Estimated duration: 2 hours
```
# ...

```
As a holiday manager,
I want a graph showing holiday usage over time,
so I can identify trends in when holidays are most frequently taken.

Estimated duration: 2 days
```

Given that I was given only 2 days to complete the project, but the total estimated time for all the user stories was 4 days, I had a discussion with the person who assigned me the task. After reasoning together, we decided to exclude the final user story to ensure I could meet the deadline.
