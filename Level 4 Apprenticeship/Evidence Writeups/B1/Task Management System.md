If I'm working independently on a large project I tend after writing user stories, I tend to convert them into tasks, and put them into a personal Kanban board and organize them into separate buckets, based on my progress with them.

Using a personal Kanban board is crucial for working independently as a software developers because it provides clear, visual insight into every stage of a project’s workflow, making it easier to prioritize tasks and stay on track. A personal Kanban board reduces the mental overhead required to remember details and deadlines. It also helps break down complex projects into manageable components, promoting a sense of progress and momentum as tasks move from “To Do” to “Done.” Through this streamlined visualization, I can spot bottlenecks early, limit their work in progress, and make data-driven decisions about how best to allocate their time. Overall, a personal Kanban board fosters greater efficiency, accountability, and continuous improvement within a developer’s daily workflow.
