Explains how they have linked code to data sets.

*To explain how you've linked code to datasets, describe a specific feature in the Intranet project where your code interacts with a database. Outline how you define models that represent database tables, using an ORM like Devart's Entity Developer to map these models to MySQL. Explain how you use LINQ or SQL queries within your code to retrieve, manipulate, and display data. Highlight any steps you took to ensure data integrity and efficiency, such as writing optimized queries or handling exceptions. Conclude by discussing how this data integration supports the functionality of the feature you developed.*

The main tool we use at Labman to link code to data sets would be Devart's Object Relationship Mapper - Entity Developer. This allows us to develop a database from a model-first-approach, which can update the database structure, and generate C# data models. Using these C# data models, you're able to query data sets with Language Integrated Queries (LINQ) in code, which then gets translated into parametrized SQL to be ran on our server, of which response data is mapped into C# objects.

As an example, for work, I developed this method:
![[Pasted image 20240822165313.png]]

It takes a userId and roleName to check if the user has a certain permission, returning true if they do.

This LINQ gets translated into the following SQL:
```sql
SELECT EXISTS
    (
        SELECT t1.*
        FROM users t1
        WHERE (t1.id = :p0) AND (EXISTS
            (
                SELECT t2.id, t2.permission, t2.defaultrole, t2.description
                FROM userpermissions t2
                INNER JOIN userpermissionassignment t3 ON t3.userpermissionid = t2.id
                WHERE (t2.permission = :p1) AND (t1.id = t3.userid)
                )
            )
        )
     AS C1
-- p0: Input Int (Size = 0; DbType = Int32) [2120]
-- p1: Input VarChar (Size = 25; DbType = AnsiString) [New Starter Board Manager]
-- Context: Devart.Data.MySql.Linq.Provider.MySqlDataProvider Mapping: AttributeMappingSource Build: 5.0.151.0
```

It also allows us to create and update records using code, for example this bit of code finds a bug record, and updates it's durationunits and lastupdatedon fields:
![[Pasted image 20240823101251.png]]

And this bit of code inserts a bugcomment into the bugcomments table:
