### Applies the principles and uses of relational and non-relational databases to software development tasks.

*Identify a specific feature in the Intranet project that involves data storage or retrieval. For relational databases, explain how you design normalized tables in MySQL, use SQL queries, and leverage relationships like foreign keys for data integrity. If applicable, for non-relational databases, describe scenarios where you might use a NoSQL database (like MongoDB) for handling unstructured data, emphasizing flexibility and scalability. Implement and document a feature using these principles, comparing how each database type supports different aspects of the application's requirements.*

A relational database has more than one table and the tables are linked using key fields. For example, a school database could have three tables:
1.  Student - when a student joins the school a record is created. It stores their details such as their first name and surname and includes a unique Student Id.
2. Classroom - each classroom in the school has a record. It stores details about the classroom, such as room number, maximum capacity and includes a unique classroom id.
3. Enrolment - when a student enrols to a classroom, the enrolment table stores the students unique id and the books unique id in a record. The record also includes additional information such as when the student enrolled.

The student and classroom id are both examples of key fields.
#### Advantages
- The classroom's details and the student's details need only be entered into the database once.
- Because of this, mistakes are less likely to happen and if there were a mistake in a student's record, for example, correcting it will correct the mistake database-wide.
- Duplication is avoided - this keeps the database's file size down.
- Details about classrooms and students are easily accessible using their unique IDs.
- Queries can be performed and reports generated, e.g. a list of classrooms a student has enrolled since joining the school.

On the intranet at Labman, we use the MySQL for our relational database. One of my tasks at work was to add tags to components. The relationship between these tables would be many to many. Many to many relationships use an associative(or junction) table to connect them. With this knowledge, I created the componenttagassignments table, containing the fields ComponentId and TagId, which schema looks like:

By making the tag and component tables have a one to many with the junction table, it allows for the many to many relationship. The entity relationship diagram would look like:

A non-relational database, is any kind of database that doesn't use the tables, fields, and columns structured data concept from relational database. Non-relational databases have been designed with the cloud in mind, making them great at horizontal scaling. There are a few different groups of database types that store the data in different ways:

1. Document databases - Document databases store data in a format where each entry is a document, typically resembling a JSON structure. These documents can contain a wide range of data types, such as strings, numbers (including integers, floats, and longs), dates, objects, arrays, and even other embedded documents. The data within these documents is organized in key/value pairs.

2. Key-value database - A key-value database is the simplest type of database, where data is stored in pairs consisting of a key and a value. The key serves as a unique identifier used to retrieve the corresponding value from the database. This straightforward structure offers the advantage of speed, as data retrieval and storage are efficient. Whether the value is the actual data or a reference to it, the simplicity of key-value databases ensures consistently fast read and write operations.

3. Graph database - Graph databases are a highly specialized type of non-relational database designed to handle complex relationships between data. They utilize a structure composed of nodes, which store data, and edges, which define and contain attributes about the relationships between these nodes. This organization allows for rapid queries involving relationships, as the connections are inherently built into the database's structure. Graph databases are also highly flexible, allowing for the easy addition of new nodes and edges without requiring a predefined schema, unlike traditional relational databases.

4. Wide-column databases - Wide-column databases, while similar to relational databases in that they store data in tables, columns, and rows, offer more flexibility. Unlike relational databases, the columns in a wide-column database donâ€™t need to have consistent names or formats across all rows. Additionally, columns can be distributed across multiple servers. These databases are often referred to as two-dimensional key-value stores because they use multi-dimensional mapping, allowing data to be referenced by both row and column.

#### Advantages:
- Non-relational databases are suitable for both operational and transactional data.
- They are more suitable for unstructured big data.
- Non-relational databases offer higher performance and availability.
- Flexible schema help non-relational databases store more data of varied types that can be changed without major schema changes.
