### Suggests and applies different software design approaches and patterns, to identify reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems (include bespoke or off-the-shelf) **(Evaluates and recommends approaches to using reusable solutions to common problems.)**

*Identify a recurring problem in the Intranet project, such as data validation. Research and evaluate relevant design patterns (like the Repository or Strategy Pattern), and choose one that best addresses the issue. Implement the chosen pattern in a specific module, ensuring it integrates well with the existing architecture. Test the solution to validate its effectiveness and document the process, reflecting on how the pattern improved the project's maintainability and reusability.*

One recurring issue within one of our modules was standardization of data access methods from the business layer.  On the intranet, for each database entity, we should have the following methods: List (get a list of records with given filters applied), GetById (get singular record with id), Create (create and return singular record), Update (update and return record), and ArchiveById (give archivedon and archivedby fields a value and return the record). After doing some research the best approach for this was for us to use the repository pattern.

The repository pattern provides an abstraction of data persistence, so that your application can work with a simple abstraction (that your domain model owns) that has an interface approximating that of a collection. Adding, removing, updating, and selecting items from this collection is done through a series of straightforward methods, without the need to deal with database concerns like connections, commands, cursors, or readers.

To persist this throughout our business layers, I decided to create a generic repository interface, of which each business layer class would inherit from, causing errors during compile time if the interface is not implemented:

```cs
public interface IRepository<TDto, TFilterObject> 
{
	public List<TDto> List(TFilterObject filters);

	public TDto GetById(int id);

	public TDto Create(TDto obj);

	public TDto Update(TDto obj);

	public TDto ArchiveById(int id);
}
```

After applying this to our CalendarController business layer class, because it doesn't implement anything on the interface, it throws up errors, meaning that developers have to follow the interface or else their code won't work:
