### Describes the roles and responsibilities of the project lifecycle within their organisation, and their role.

*Identify and describe the key roles in the project lifecycle at Labman, such as project manager, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders. Explain their responsibilities at different stages of the project, from planning to deployment. Then, focus on your role in the lifecycle—such as contributing to coding, participating in design discussions, or assisting with testing—and how your responsibilities fit into the broader project workflow. Highlight how your work supports the project's progress and aligns with the organization's goals.*

Our project lifecycle and key roles:
At Labman, development for the intranet is split into feedback tickets. The author of the ticket flags up an issue or feature request, which is then reviewed by the intranet's Project Manager, if he approves of the ticket, he'll give it an estimated work duration, a complexity measurement, and move it into the development backlog. From here, a senior engineer or the system's owner will write a technical specification for the ticket - with help from the products designer for any UI/UX work, and then assign it to a software developer. The software developer will work on the item by coding it, and when they're happy with it, they'll write a test plan (steps to fully test the changes) and deployment plan (steps to successfully deploy the changes, such as the SQL migration script and disaster plan) - then send it over to a senior engineer for a code review, if they are happy with it, it will be sent to a QA tester. If the QA tester finds any issues, it will be send back to the software developer for him to fix. This will repeat until there are no issues within the code. The branch the developer has been working on will then be merged into the main git branch, our continuous integration pipeline will be triggered causing a new container to be built with the devs code. The deployment plan will then be sent to the deployment engineer, if he encounters any issues with the deployment he will follow the disaster plan.

My role in the lifecycle:
While working at Labman, my main role has been software developer, giving me the responsibility of programming the feature/bug request in a high enough quality standard for other devs to easily maintain in the future. We also out-source a lot of our software developing work to contractors, this has given me the chance to write technical specifications, design UI, code review, and QA test tickets.
