# K1
- Describes all stages of the software development lifecycle.
To describe all stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), start with the **Planning** phase, where project goals, scope, and requirements are defined. Next is the **Analysis** phase, which involves gathering detailed requirements and defining system specifications. The **Design** phase follows, where the architecture and user interfaces are planned. After design, the **Implementation** or **Development** phase involves writing and compiling the code according to the design specifications.

Once development is complete, the **Testing** phase ensures that the software functions correctly and meets all requirements, often including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests. The **Deployment** phase follows, where the software is released to users and made operational in the production environment. Finally, the **Maintenance** phase involves ongoing support, including fixing bugs, making updates, and improving performance, ensuring the software continues to meet user needs and adapt to changing conditions.

# K5
- Describes the similarities and differences between different software development methodologies, such as agile and waterfall.

Describe the similarities and differences between Agile and Waterfall methodologies. Both are frameworks for managing software development, but they differ in approach. **Waterfall** is linear and sequential, with distinct phases like planning, design, implementation, and testing, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It's best for projects with well-defined requirements. **Agile**, on the other hand, is iterative and flexible, breaking projects into small, manageable increments (sprints) that allow for continuous feedback and adaptation. Agile promotes collaboration and is ideal for projects where requirements may evolve. Both methodologies aim to deliver a high-quality product but differ in structure, flexibility, and adaptability to change.

# S9
- Creates analysis artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories to enable effective delivery of software activities.

To demonstrate your ability to create analysis artifacts for effective software delivery, focus on developing comprehensive use cases or user stories for a particular feature of the Intranet project. Start by identifying the stakeholders and their needs, which will form the basis of your user stories or use cases.

For **use cases**, outline the interactions between the user and the system, detailing the steps involved in each process. Include actors, preconditions, main flows, alternate flows, and postconditions to provide a clear, structured view of system behavior.

For **user stories**, adopt a more user-centered approach, framing each requirement as a narrative. Each user story should follow a simple template: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]." Accompany these stories with acceptance criteria to define when a story is completed and meets the necessary standards.

By integrating these artifacts into project planning and development processes, you can enhance communication among the team and ensure that software activities are aligned with user needs and project goals. This method also helps in prioritizing features based on their value to the user, facilitating effective and agile software development.
