### What is a diff?

The differential is a key component in a car that helps deliver torque to the drive wheels while allowing them to turn at different speeds during a turn. Whether the car is a front-wheel, rear-wheel, or all-wheel drive, the differential is necessary.

The differential is a system that allows the drive wheels to turn at different speeds, which is required when the car is negotiating a turn. In a turn, the outside wheel must travel farther, which means it must rotate faster than the inside wheels.

The differential is made up of various parts, including the ring and pinion gears, spider gears, and side gears. The location of the diff depends on the drive system of the vehicle, with front-wheel drive vehicles often having a transaxle and rear-wheel drive vehicles having a separate rear differential.

There are different types of diffs, including open diffs, limited-slip diffs, locking diffs, and torque-vectoring diffs, each with its own advantages and uses. Signs of a worn-out diff include driveline noise and vibrations, grinding or clunking sounds, strange sounds when turning, whining or whirring sounds and oil leaks.

### How do they work?

The main components of the diff are the ring and pinion gears. The ring gear is attached to the carrier assembly, and inside the carrier is a set of smaller gears.

These smaller gears are often referred to as spider gears, which are made up of another set of pinion gears and the side gears. It is the set of gears that supplies the diff action. Following the power flow inside the diff, the pinion gear drives the ring gear, which rotates the carrier.

The carrier then drives the smaller pinion gears, which in turn drive the side gears. The drive axles are splined into the side gears, which then drive the wheels.

The differential is found in the front- or rear-axle assembly on all late-model cars and trucks. In all-wheel drive (AWD) applications, there will also be a centre diff driving both front and rear axle assemblies.
