The smaller the service the more you maximize the benefits of the microservice architecture. A microservice is a separate entity, it might be deployed as an isolated service on a platform as a service (PAAS), or it might be its own operating system process. All communication between the services themselves are via network calls, to enforce separation between the services and avoid the perils of tight coupling.
