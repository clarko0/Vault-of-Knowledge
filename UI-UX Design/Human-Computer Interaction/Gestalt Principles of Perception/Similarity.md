When things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together. And... we also tend to thing they have the same function.

Design elements, like colour and organisation, can be used to set up similar groups.

For example, even though all of the shapes are the same, it's clear that each column represents a distinct group.

Use it to distinguish different sections. The colour blue is used to distinguish links from regular test and to communicate that all blue text shares a common function.
