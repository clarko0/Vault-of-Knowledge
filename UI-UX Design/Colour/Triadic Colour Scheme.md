A triadic colour scheme utilizes colours which are evenly spaced on the colour wheel. For example: yellow, blue and orange.

If using a triadic colour scheme, pick a dominant colour and two secondary colours. Otherwise it would be tricky to balance all three colours without it appearing jarring to look at.
